## FAQ

**How do business lending marketplaces make money if applications are free?**
Marketplaces typically earn fees from lenders when successfully matching borrowers with funded loans, similar to how mortgage brokers operateâ€”the lender pays the marketplace a placement fee once the loan closes. This means borrowers don't pay direct fees to use marketplace services, though individual loan products carry their own interest rates and origination fees set by lenders. Some platforms like Lendio explicitly state they don't charge borrowers directly, instead earning from lender relationships.

**Will applying through a marketplace hurt my credit score?**
Most marketplaces use soft credit pulls during initial applications that don't impact your credit score, only performing hard pulls once you select a specific lender and move forward with formal application. This allows comparing multiple lender offers without credit score damage versus applying directly to 5-10 individual lenders triggering multiple hard inquiries. Always verify the marketplace's credit pull policy before submitting sensitive information.

**Can I negotiate better terms with lenders found through marketplaces?**
Generally noâ€”marketplace lenders present their standard offers based on your financial profile, and negotiation opportunities are limited since pricing is algorithmically determined. However, some marketplaces like Lendio provide funding managers who advocate on your behalf, potentially securing better terms through their lender relationships. Your best leverage comes from comparing multiple offers and choosing the most favorable terms rather than negotiating individual offers.
